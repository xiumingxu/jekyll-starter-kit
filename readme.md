# Jekyll Starter Kit
In this project we will learn bunch of new things like sass, jekyll , jade(pug) & gulp etc to use modern way of coding wesites!

Project setup

*	1 Clone this repo.
*	2 now open bash terminal for project directory and use following command npm i to install packages

Finally on command line in  project directory use 'gulp --watch' or "gulp" this will open  browser nodejs server at localhost:3000 deploying pages from _site directory generated in your project folder and when you make changes in  your sass and jade file's they will be reflected in your server site on  save gulp server will also refresh your browser Hope this helps thank 
in advance for using my setup!
